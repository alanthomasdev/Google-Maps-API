🗺️ Google Maps React Integration: Clusters, Markers, InfoWindows &amp; Polygons



### Description:
This repository contains a fully functional Google Maps integration using @vis.gl/react-google-maps in a React application. It includes:

#### ✅ Clustered Markers: Efficiently groups markers when zoomed out to improve performance and readability.
#### ✅ Search Bar with Country Selection: Users can search for a country, and it will be highlighted on the map.
#### ✅ Polygon Overlays: When a country is selected, its boundary is displayed using a polygon.
#### ✅ State-Level Interactions: Clicking on a state displays an InfoWindow with relevant details.
#### ✅ Dynamic Data Integration: Preloaded donation-related data dynamically appears on interactions.
#### ✅ Smooth Performance: Optimized rendering for fast and interactive maps.



## Steps. 

### Please use Maps.tsx as a component and setup the rest of the files. 
### /app/components/maps
Polygon.jsx
Polyline.jsx
I have added a demo json file from 
## https://geojson-maps.kyd.au/

## /public/maps/
custom.geoindia.json (contains GeoJson)
marker.js (contains data of the markers)
